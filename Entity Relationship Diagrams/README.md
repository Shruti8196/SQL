1. For each doctor it keeps track of the DoctorID (unique), DoctorName, and DoctorYearofMDGraduation (year graduated from medical school).
2. For each output location it keeps track of the OLID (Outpatient Location ID; unique) and OLName (Outpatient Location Name).
3. Each doctor works at either one outpatient location or at no outpatient locations (because the doctor works only in the main hospital instead), 
and each outpatient location can have between none (if the location is used to treat rehab and minor health issues only) and many doctors working at it.
